# Image Classification Project

What are the different types of algorithms used to classify images? How does a binary classifier differ from a multiclass identifier? How does building a Convolutional Neural Network compare to using pre-built algorithms such as ResNet50? These questions are answered in this project.
Using built in datasets from the Keras package, as well as images pulled from the web, this project builds several different image classification models to test and evalutate the performance and use-cases of the different image classification algorithms. Models are evaluated on both loss and accuracy,
and plots are used to demonstrate change across epochs.
