# Movie Review Sentiment Analysis
This project aims to build sentiment analysis models to predict whether a movie review is positive or negative. It first builds a logistic regression sentiment analysis model. However, this model does not perform as well as it could. Then, I build a random forest classifier model which
succeeds in predicting the sentiment with a precisions score of 85%.
