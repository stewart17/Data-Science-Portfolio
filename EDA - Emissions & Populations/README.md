# Exploratory Data Analysis 
## The Relationship Between Emissions & Populations

The purpose of this project was to investigation the relationship betweene emissions and population. It is a common refrain that overpopulation contributes to climate change because more people leads to more emissions. However, does this relationship actually exist?
I conducted a variety of visualizations and statistical analyses to see what the relationship was. While I did find a positive relationship between emissions and population, I also found there to be other significant indicators of higher emissions, such as GDP.
This leaves open the possibility that there is/are underlying reason(s) aside from population that lead to greater CO2 emissions. Futher analysis should investigate the relationship between economic production and CO2 emissions compared to the impact of individual people.
